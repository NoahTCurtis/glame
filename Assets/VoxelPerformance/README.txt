Thank you for trying Voxel Performance for Unity. Voxel Performance is a
simple, high-performance asset that may be used to create and manipulate
voxel based terrain or other large voxel structures. This asset uses a
combination of compute shaders and a geometry shader to create map chunks
with Perlin Noise and display them quickly. Chunks may also be extracted
from the compute shaders as an array of raw voxel data, an array of Unity Mesh,
or a Unity TerrainData.

This asset is licensed to you under the terms of the Unity Asset Store which
