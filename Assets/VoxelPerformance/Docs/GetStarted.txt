Getting Started With Voxel Performance

Open the scene VoxelPerformance/voxeltest

In the Hierarchy tab, you should see a component named VoxelTerrain that contains the MapGen.cs script. MapGen contains a number of options that you can change to put Voxel Performance through its paces.


* Create Sponge is a bool option that will create a level five Menger Sponge. You can read about them at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge

Creating and showing a Menger Sponge is a kind of stress test for the asset. This object is a pattern of 3,200,000 solid voxels, each of which has at least one face exposed. The raw voxel form of a Voxel Performance chunk always takes up about 16 MB (256*256*256 bytes), and the optimized form of this object sent to the geometry shader for display is about 12 MB (4 * 3,200,000). Normal voxel terrain chunks use about 512 KB in their optimized form.

If Create Sponge is selected, only one chunk will be generated (the one that contains the sponge).


* Show Voxels is a bool option that will send an optimized form of the generated chunks to the geometry shader using the Prefab in DisplayPrefab (MapDisplay).

* Create Mesh is a bool option that will display each generated chunk as an array of Unity Mesh objects using the Prefab in MeshPrefab (MeshDisplay).

* Create Unity Terrain is a bool option that will display each generated chunk as a Unity Terrain Object. Terrain will not be created for a Menger Sponge.

* Chunk Max is the maximum X and Z dimensions of the generated map. The default value (4) will generate a 4x4 array of chunks with a total size of 1024x1024 voxels on the surface.


* Size is the scale factor for voxels. If you change this value, you may wish to change options on the Main Camera such as Far Clipping Plane and VPCamera Speed.


The Console will display timing for creating meshes and terrain, if those options are selected as above. It will also show a message as it creates each chunk.

Press and hold Q to stop map generation and release the GPU buffers properly before you quit. Otherwise, the Console will show an error message for each buffer not released.
